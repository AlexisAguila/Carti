So Firebase has been set up for this app. I added Firebase to the Android project and followed
the "Before you begin" steps on the link below so we should be set upo and ready to go for
the text recognition later on.

***Status 02/13/20:

Added a variety of features so yall can practice and understand how to program on android. Code includes comments with whats happening. Currently the app works as a counter which includes two buttons. The top button displays a welcome message that fades out of the screen after 2.5 seconds and the bottom button updates the number in the middle of the screen, counting how many times youve pressed the button. I will be slowly adding features as im learning and removing others until the features fit for what we need. Hope my code can help you guys understand Android. I will also be making a new branch called, "Images" where we can post what our app looks like so we can all have an idea of our progress and easily see what changes were made on which date. The nameing format for the images will be "Image-02/13" with the date on the right side (excluding year).

Also, this file is to keep everyone updated so any changes you make, report them here using this format with three * which makes a word bolded when file is opened so that things are easier to track.
